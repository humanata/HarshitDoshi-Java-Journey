# Java Journey by HarshitDoshi

## Technologies

1. Spring Boot [In-Progress]
2. Lombok
3. JPA
4. Hibernate
5. Mockito

## Tools that I am using

- VSCode (tried IntelliJ IDEA, not my cup of Java)
- Spring Initializer (extension on VSCode)
- Java Development Kit v17 (using SDKMAN)
- Gradle (using SDKMAN) (No idea why I chose this over Maven, just liked their website better)
